				<h4>Narrative</h4>
				<div class="grampsstylednote">
					<p>
					1767.<br />
					The SevenYears' War was lately ended - the Napoleonic wars were yet to come. Indeed it wasn't until 1769 that Arthur Wellesley was born in Dublin an Napoleon Bonaparte in Corsica. George III hadn't long been king in England - Queen Victoria's father would be an infant at that time. In a little town in northern England was born one Jacob Bales, who was to outlive Nelson and Napoleon and Edward, Duke of Kent, and even the Duke of Wellington who lived to the age of eighty three.<br />
					Jacob was born in Alston and he died there, but in between these two events, he had a few adventures. He earned his living as a toll-gate keeper and had two sons, John and Joseph. The latter was only seventeen when he said farewell to his brother, who marched from Alston to Whitehaven in May 1818, there to board the "Jacond" for Upper Canada. There he had the wisdom ,or the luck, to get himself a farm which later was incorporated into the city of Toronto. So his descendants grew rich enough to be hosts to the Prince of Wales (Bertie, I presume) at a later date.<br />
					Meanwhile Joseph and Ann Lee were married on Christmas Day, 1825, both being twenty four years old. They had a family of eight, five sons and three daughters, one of whom died in infancy. When the eldest of these, Sarah, was twenty three, they decided to take a step they had long been contemplating - to emigrate to Canada.<br />
					They sold their house in Alston, with the proviso that they could buy it back if they returned. The two girls, Sarah &amp; Hannah (aged eighteen) went on horseback to Gretna Green with their boyfriends and their parents' blessing and were married at the local smithy. Then they packed their bags and set forth -Jacob, now eighty three, Joseph, Ann, their seven children and their two new sons-in-law.<br />
					It must have been before John struck it rich, because the venture was not a success and the party, increased to thirteen by the birth of Marion Armstrong, came back to Alston a year or so later. The return was not without its adventures either. Their  ship was wrecked in the St Lawrence and they all had to scramble off onto a small island. When the baby, being transferred from ship to shore in a sling, was seen to be slipping, a sailor jumped into the water to catch her as she fell, and she arrived sopping wet. Jacob's rescue was a problem because by now he was blind. They led him along a plank with instructions to jump as far as he could and he put so much effort into his leap that he burst all the buttons off his pants.<br />
					 In relating this story, the family in England seemed to think that it was remarkable that , inspite of their vicissitudes, they all returned safely to Alston, although there were thirteen in the party,worthy ancestors of the Australian family, who never walked under ladders, always left a house through the door by which they had entered- for fear of leaving their luck behind - and were most reluctant to commence anything on a Friday. When any one of my aunts broke a cup or a dish, she would dash outside and smash two of those common old marble-stopperd bottles, because breakages always go in threes. In fact, all misfortunes do.<br />
					But alas, when they returned to the old home town, they could not afford to buy back the old house.<br />
					 In 1928, we (Ida &amp;May) saw a number of tombstones with the family names on them, but these were no longer to be found on later visits. The names William and Alfred, John and Hannah cropped up in every branch of the family. Grandfather's mother was Ann Lee and the name is perpetuated in the names of my cousin Jack and Pat's son Donne.<br />
					Grandfather's elder sister, Sarah Armstrong had a large family, two of whom were David and Robert, and each of these had sons David and Robert. When, in 1928, Ida<br />
					 and I were visiting Tom Bales in Newcastle-on-Tyne he took us to see anumber of other cousins.  Robert Armstrong had a fine housee and a good job as head of big engineering firm- Tom Bales lived in the humble terrace house in which he had been born. We went to David Armstrong's by train one day and Tom explained that this cousin had always been a bit of a rolling stone and so had not gathered much moss. to the question' How long had he lived in his present house?', we were staggered to receive the answer "Twenty five years" This David was the father of the four, Cissie, Robert, Mary and David whom we ( Bill, Carol, Dorothy and Kirsten) met when we visited Haverings in Essex, in 1966. Our hostess was Mary (Brunwin).<br />
					Grandfather Joseph was twenty five when he left England to make his fortune at the goldfields in Australia. His mother worried because he went in "one of those new-fangled steam ships", instead of a good, reliable sailing ship. He didn't make a fortune. He married in 1867, being then aged thirty three, and his mother wept to hear the news" Now Joe will never come back". And Joe never did, though to the end of his days he hoped to.
